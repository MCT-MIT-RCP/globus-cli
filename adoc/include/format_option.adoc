*-F, --format* '[json|text|unix]'::

Set the output format for stdout. Defaults to "text".
+
*TEXT* output is human-friendly textual output, usually in table or
record-oriented format.
In some cases, *TEXT* format is intentionally kept simple to support naive use
of commands within a subshell, but it is not generally guaranteed to be
parseable.
+
*JSON* output will produce raw JSON data from underlying Globus services.
This data is useful for using the CLI as part of a programmatic process, or for
deciding on valid *--jmespath* queries.
+
*UNIX* output will produce a line-by-line serialization of the result data
(which would be visible with *JSON*).
This is very suitable for use in pipelines with `grep`, `sort`, and other
standard unix tools.
+
Whenever you request *--format=UNIX*, you should also be using a *--jmespath*
query to select the exact fields that you want.
This better guarantees the consistency of output contents and ordering.
